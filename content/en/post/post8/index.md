# Productive everyday life

1. I spent the weekend doing all my homework, so I was very tired. I prepared a lot for tests in mathematical analysis.

2. Wrote a paper on mathematical analysis.

3. I continue to do labs on operating systems.

5. I finally gave a report on operating systems, now I need to prepare for a test in math. analysis.



## Waiting for warm weather

Last week it was snowing and it was really surprising!
