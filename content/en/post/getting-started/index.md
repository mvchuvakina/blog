## Daily routine
 
1. On Monday there were only online couples, so I woke up at 8:30. I washed my face, turned on my laptop and listened to lectures. Then at 13.30 I had German, so I had to get ready and go to the university. Afterwards I went to the display class for laboratory work on operating systems, and eventually returned home at about 9.30.
 
2. On Tuesday I had an online class again, after which I went to the university to do laboratory work on operating systems. And again I returned home around 9.
 
3. On Wednesday and Thursday I need to get up at 6.00 to get ready and go to the first couple and this is very difficult. In addition, there are 4-5 pairs at once, after which I again go to the display class and do laboratory work there until 8 or 9 pm.
 
4. On Friday I have English 3 pairs.
 
5. On Saturday I try to do all my homework so that I can be freer later.
 
6. On Sunday I have a lot of housework and rest.
 
 
## Hobby
 
Whenever possible, I try to devote time to my hobbies. For example, last week on Sunday I went to the cinema to see the film "Ice 3". I liked it very much. As for books, I haven’t been able to find time for them lately, which is very sad.
