# Not very interesting everyday life

1. I spent the weekend doing all my homework, so I was very tired.

2. I slept very little, so I felt sleepy all day.

3. I continue to do labs on operating systems.

5. You need to force yourself to give a report on operating systems.

## Spring is coming

A fact that canâ€™t help but make us happy is that spring has finally arrived, which means the warmth will come soon. I don't like cold and frost!
